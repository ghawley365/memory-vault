"""
Choosing an event loop psycopg can use, on Windows.

Windows defaults to `ProactorEventLoop`, and psycopg refuses to run on it —
`AsyncConnection.connect` raises `InterfaceError` before attempting any network
I/O. The pool reads that as a failed connection and retries; every retry raises
instantly. Start-up becomes a burst of identical warnings and a multi-second
delay before anything works.

Reproduced on Windows 11 with the versions this package pins (psycopg 3.3.5,
psycopg-pool 3.3.1):

    loop: ProactorEventLoop
    WARNING error connecting in 'pool-1': Psycopg cannot use the
      'ProactorEventLoop' to run in async mode. ...        (x3)
    OUTCOME: PoolTimeout pool initialization incomplete after 5 sec

and with the selector policy forced, on the same machine:

    loop: _WindowsSelectorEventLoop
    OUTCOME: PoolTimeout pool initialization incomplete after 5 sec

Zero guard errors. The remaining timeout is the probe pointing at a dead port
on purpose — what changed is *why* it failed.

These tests run on Linux in CI, where `WindowsSelectorEventLoopPolicy` does not
exist and the function is a no-op. So they assert on the decision the function
makes rather than on a policy it cannot set here: that it declines on this
platform, that it is wired into import, and that it leaves a caller's own
choice alone. The Windows behaviour itself was verified on Windows.

"""Serving MCP over HTTP, mounted into the REST application.

The MCP server has always spoken stdio, which assumes the client runs on the
same machine. Remote harnesses cannot attach without an SSH tunnel or routing
stdio through `docker exec`. This mounts the same tools at `/api/mcp` so a
client elsewhere on the network can reach them.

Off unless `MCP_HTTP_ENABLED` says otherwise. A memory store is not something
to start listening on a port by default.
